markdown # DotNet 7 Core REST API Project ## Overview This project is built using DotNet 7 Core and follows REST architectural principles. The goal was to create a scalable, secure, and maintainable API. ## Project Structure The project is structured into three layers: - API Layer: Handles HTTP requests and responses. - Service Layer: Implements business logic. - Data Layer: Manages data access using Entity Framework (EF) with Database First approach. ## Key Features - Validation: Input validations are strictly enforced. - Password Strength: Passwords are validated using the zxcvbn package. - Dependency Injection (DI): Used to maintain encapsulation and promote scalability. - Asynchronous Programming: All functions use async and await to support non-blocking operations. - Configuration: Configurations are managed using configuration files to handle environment-specific settings. - Error Handling: Errors are appropriately captured, logged, and in the event of an issue, an email notification is sent. - Swagger Documentation: All API endpoints are documented using Swagger. - HTTPS Support: The project uses HTTPS for secure communication. - DTO Layer: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are used for data representation. - Automapper: Used for converting between DTOs and entities. - Product Pricing: Pricing information is fetched directly from the database. - Traffic Monitoring: All API traffic is logged in the rating table for analysis. ## Installation 1. Clone the repository: `sh git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepository.git cd YourRepository ` 2. Set up the database: - This project uses Entity Framework with Database First approach. Make sure your database is up and running. - Update the connection string in the configuration file. 3. Run the project: `sh dotnet run ` ## Testing Unit and integration tests are included in the project. You can run the tests using the following command: `sh dotnet test ` ## Data Population Data population for development purposes can be done using the data population project found at: webApi_manager ## Contributions Contributions are welcome.
